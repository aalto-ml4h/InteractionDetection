# Learning Global Pairwise Interactions with Bayesian Neural Networks
This repository contains the appendix for the paper 'Learning Global Pairwise Interactions with Bayesian Neural Networks'.

#### Toy example on the energy efficiency dataset:
Please find a demostration of GEH on the energy efficiency dataset in "/demo/GEH-Demo.ipynb".
We provide a trained concrete dropout BNN on that dataset for demonstration:
- "/demo/main_effect_CD_softReLU_Energy.pth" for the main effect model
- "/demo/mlp_CD_softReLU_Energy.pth" for the MLP.

We also provide the training code of concrete dropout in "/demo/GEH-Demo.ipynb" (adopted from the original [code](https://github.com/yaringal/ConcreteDropout)) for users to apply on their own datasets.
